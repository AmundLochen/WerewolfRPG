	"description": "Intimidation involves applying pressure to make someone else do what you want them to. It can take many forms, from soft, subtle persuasion to outright brute force. Intimidation need not be cruel or callous; a well- placed intimidating conversation might even be called “diplomatic.” An intimidating character knows what to do and say depending on the occasion, and is very persuasive when he wants something done.",
