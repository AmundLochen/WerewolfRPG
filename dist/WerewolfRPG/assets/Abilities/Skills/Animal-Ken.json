	"description": "Humans think and behave far differently to other animals. It takes a special touch to deal with other creatures, especially if they’re hurt or frightened. A person (or werewolf) with Animal Ken knows how to speak and move in such a way to gain an animal’s trust. Without it, even homid werewolves have a hard time dealing with animals that can sense their Rage.<br><br> Animal Ken is also necessary for training animals and for working closely with animals (such as leading a mule train).",
