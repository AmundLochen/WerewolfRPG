	"name": "Perception",
	"description": "Perception measures the character’s sensitivity to her surroundings. It’s a combination of actively monitoring the area around her while also relying on instincts and gut feeling. Perception doesn’t normally involve intense concentration; it’s more like a certain sensitivity to what’s going on in the immediate vicinity.<br><br> Perception comes in handy when characters search for clues, maintain alertness for ambushes or seek hidden knowledge. Many lupus have high Perception, as they’re used to synthesizing information from all of their senses. Characters who are cynical or jaded don’t rely on their Perception as much as they should.",
