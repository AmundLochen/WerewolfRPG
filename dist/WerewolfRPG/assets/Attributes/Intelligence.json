	"name": "Intelligence",
	"description": "The Intelligence Attribute covers a character’s grasp of facts and knowledge. It also governs her ability to reason, solve problems, and evaluate situations. It’s not just IQ; instead, Intelligence involves how well a character can make sense of seemingly random facts and data, organizing them into usable and constructive patterns.<br><br> Lateral thinking and leaps of intuition are also part of Intelligence, as is logic, both deductive and inductive. Having a low Intelligence doesn’t necessarily imply stupidity; the character could be uneducated, or only able to think in simple patterns. Likewise, a high Intelligence doesn’t make a character Stephen Hawking. Instead, the character is just a whiz at pulling together individual bits of information.",
