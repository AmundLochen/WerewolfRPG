	"description": "Charisma isn’t really about good looks; rather, it’s innate charm, personality, and power of influence. A character’s Charisma comes into question when she tries to win another character’s sympathies or encourage others to trust her. Characters with a high Charisma Trait generally serve as inspiration for their fellows, exuding an air of trust and likability.<br><br> Whether she’s a silver-tongued charmer or a personable bully, other people depend on her to provide motivation and encouragement. Characters with low Charisma have a hard time getting people to see things their way. They do and say the wrong things, and they generally end up pissing off people who might otherwise be friends.",
