	"description": "Strength is a measure of how much weight the character can carry, shove, or lift. Strength figures into jumping and leaping, and it also measures the raw damage you can deliver in a fight.<br><br> The higher your Strength is, the more punishing your blows are. Generally, characters with high Strength are big and brawny, although this is not always the case; the short and wiry types can also pack quite a punch.",
