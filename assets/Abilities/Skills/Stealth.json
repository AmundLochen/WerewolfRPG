	"description": "Stealth allows a character to avoid being seen or heard, whether moving through cover and shadows, hiding in a crowd, or shadowing someone on his route home. Most uses of Stealth are contested by someone else’s Perception + Alertness, with whoever rolls the most successes thwarting the other.<br><br> The Storyteller should keep in mind that staying hidden in a forest is very different to hiding out in an urban alleyway. Stealth is also used for hiding items, either on one’s person when being searched or in the environment.",
