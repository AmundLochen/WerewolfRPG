	"name": "Melee",
	"description": "The counterpart to Firearms and Brawl, the Melee Skill involves fighting up close and personal with a weapon. A master of Melee can use a sword, spear, staff, or a wooden stake with equal ease. Werewolves use this Skill to fight with klaives — silver fetish blades. This Skill covers weapons from around the world, such as tonfa, kukri, and shotels.<br><br> While modern weaponry and the Garou’s natural weapons can leave Melee feeling outdated, knives don’t run out of ammo, and a heavy club doesn’t inspire the Delirium.",
