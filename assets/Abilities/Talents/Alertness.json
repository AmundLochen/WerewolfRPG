	"description": "Alertness describes the attention that the character pays to the world around him, whether he’s actively looking or not. It measures how attuned the character is to things that he can see, smell, hear, and touch — and to the less tangible conclusions that come from his senses.<br><br> In combat, it’s often paired with Wits to gauge a character’s reaction time and ability to respond; out of combat, it’s most usually paired with Perception to gain clues about a character’s surroundings.",
