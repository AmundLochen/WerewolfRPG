	"description": "While Talents can be trained, they’re based on an inborn talent that every character possesses. The only way to improve Talents is through direct practice and experience — with a very few exceptions, reading a book or watching an online video doesn’t provide the same feedback as actually going out and doing it. If your character attempts an action involving a Talent she doesn’t possess, your dice pool is the associated Attribute, without penalty. Talents are so intuitive that almost anyone can execute them to some degree.",
