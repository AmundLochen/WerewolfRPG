	"description": "This Talent describes a character’s connection to her bestial nature, and her level of gut feelings in her various non-human forms. A character with high Primal-Urge relies not just on her heightened instincts, but a whole range of sensory information that humans don’t fully understand.<br><br> Her understanding of her feral nature gives her an easier time when changing form, and can let her instinctively notice signs of supernatural activity — though this rarely goes beyond the level of a chill down the spine or the hairs on her neck standing on end.",
	"levels": {
		"one": "Merely a pup. The urge is there, but hasn’t been honed.",
		"two": "Your instincts put you on a safe path through danger.",
		"three": "You know when something weird is going on, and have an easy time taking the right shape to deal with it.",
		"four": "The wolf within drives you to act, and its guidance is never wrong.",
		"five": "You have an innate understanding of what it means to be Garou: a synthesis of man, wolf, and spirit created to be Gaia’s warrior."
