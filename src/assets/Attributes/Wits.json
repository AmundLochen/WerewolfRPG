	"description": "A character’s Wits Trait represents her capacity for cleverness, planning, and quick thinking. It affects a character’s reaction time in combat and his adaptability to new stimuli. Characters with low Wits are gullible and not particularly fast on the uptake.<br><br> Characters with high Wits, on the other hand, keep cool in stressful circumstances, and can come up with a new plan in a split second to react to changing circumstances. This Attribute comes in handy both in lively conversation and during the heat of a fight.",
